# binary-classification
i used all the data preprocessing methods to reach to that shape of data.
in the first using the data plotting, i only used LogisticRegression with accuracy 79%.
i tried many algorithms but without improving in the performance and keep oing with that data to make it better to fit.
i used two models SGDClassifier with accuracy 81% and Logistic Regression with accuracy 78.5%.
